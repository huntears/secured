# Secured

This repository contains a simple implementation of the 1st year secured
project.

## Differences from the subject

This implementation:
 - Does not use the given header file
 - Names the hashtable as a hashmap. Why? Because I prefer it that way :3
 - Does not compile a static library. Why? Because I couldn't be bothered
 - Uses libc function. Why? Because I couldn't be bothered to reimplement them
 - Can comment inside functions. Why? Because

This should still be enough of a reference to the project either way.
